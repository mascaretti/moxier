**** =ggplot2=
- =ggplot2= not found.
- check the =DESCRIPTION= file to check if the package is loaded. It is included!
- I wasn't loading the =ggplot2= and =dplyr= libraries. I also added =dplyr= to the required packages.
*** DONE 04-descriptive-statistics-univariate
**** Issues
- Missing =moments=, =plotrix=. 
- Data: I must move *magnesium* into the package. Apparently, a
  solution may be of doing =magnesium <- moxier::magnesium"

** External Data in Packages
I now follow [[https://r-pkgs.org/data.html][this book]] to get my head around the correct way to include data into an =R= package.
- The directory where to put it is =/data=
- The file should be a =.RData= file
- It is achieved using =usethis::use_data()=
- Raw files should be included within the =data-raw= directory.
- Data should be documented. It is not dissimilar from documenting
  functions. Documentations is stored in the =R= folder.
